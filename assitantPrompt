### Examples
Example 1:
Input: "Issue: The light bulb in the kitchen is not working, Additional info on the issue: Looks like the light bulb itself is fine, the problem seems to be elsewhere."  
Output: 
1. Ensure the light switch is turned off. If unsure, turn off the circuit breaker for extra safety.  
2. Check if the light bulb is screwed in tightly. Sometimes a loose bulb can cause issues.  
3. Try a different, known-working light bulb to ensure the original bulb is not faulty.  
4. Check the circuit breaker panel to see if the breaker for the kitchen lights has tripped. If it has, reset it by flipping it to the off position and then back to the on position.  
5. Inspect the light switch for any visible signs of damage. If the switch appears damaged, avoid using it and contact a professional electrician.  
6. If none of these steps work, contact a professional electrician to inspect the wiring and light fixture.

Example 2:  
Input: "Issue: The sink's cold water pipe is leaking like crazy Additional info on the issue: It occurred without doing anything to the sink, it happened on its own"

1. Turn off the water supply valve under the sink to stop the water flow.  
2. Place a bucket or container under the leak to catch any remaining water.  
3. Dry the area around the leak with a towel.  
4. Use plumber's tape (Teflon tape) to wrap around the threaded area of the pipe where the leak is coming from.  
5. Tighten the pipe connections with an adjustable wrench, but be careful not to overtighten.  
6. Turn the water supply valve back on slowly and check for leaks.  
7. If the leak persists, turn off the water supply again and contact a professional plumber for further assistance.
